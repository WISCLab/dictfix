Corrections to our phonetic dictionary


## Notes

How to sort the file in git bash. For some reason, redirecting to the 
original file gives me a blank file. 

```
Tristan@HONEYCOMB MINGW64 ~/Desktop
$ cat DictFix.txt | sort > DictFix-temp.txt

Tristan@HONEYCOMB MINGW64 ~/Desktop
$ mv DictFix-temp.txt DictFix.txt
```
